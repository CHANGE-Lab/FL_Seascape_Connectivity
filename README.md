# Connectivity modeling in support of coral reef restoration design 

How can functional connectivity for multi-habitat fish species be leveraged in support of marine habitat restoration design? Where should habitat restoration efforts be placed to best support and benefit from ecological interactions with multi-habitat fishes (e.g., herbivory, predation, nutrient deposition)? We addressed these questions in the context of linking coral reef restoration design to functional connectivity for two multi-habitat reef fish species in the Florida Keys, USA: gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) and bluestriped grunt (Haemulon sciurus). 

Specifically, we quantified potential functional connectivity for the migratory sub-adult life stage of gray snapper and bluestriped grunt at both the local and seascape scales using spatial graph connectivity analyses informed by spatially explicit and species-specific habitat suitability models. After constructing minimum planar (spatial) graphs using the open-access [Graphab Software](https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/graphab/en/home.html), we used the resulting connectivity networks to evaluate and rank the contributions of candidate sites prioritized for restoration under a broad-scale, multi-million dollar (USD) coral reef restoration program recently established in the Florida Keys—[Mission: Iconic Reefs](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/habitat-conservation/restoring-seven-iconic-reefs-mission-recover-coral-reefs-florida-keys)—to seascape-wide connectivity for each of the focal species.
